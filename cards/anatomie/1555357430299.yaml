Title: 'Smooth Muscle'

Clinical: '<b>Vasoconstriction</b> of vascular smooth muscle is stimulated by norepinephrine binding to adrenergic receptors on the surface of the smooth muscle cells. <b>Alpha blockers</b> are used to inhibit binding of  norepinephrine to its receptor and act to decrease smooth muscle tone and increase vessel diameter.'
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b> Most smooth muscle activity is regulated by the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system. Axonal varicosities are focal sites that contain vesicles filled with neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine, or a variety of other neurotransmitters. Gap junctions between smooth muscle cells allow excitation to spread between adjacent cells, resulting in synchronous contractions. Extrinsic factors such as circulating hormones can also stimulate contraction (e.g., oxytocin in the uterus during parturition). Moreover, local substances such as histamine and serotonin or physical factors like stretch can influence smooth muscle activity.'
