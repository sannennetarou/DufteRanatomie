Title: 'Male Pelvic Contents: Superior View'

OccludedImage: '<img src="MSA-Male_Pelvic_Contents-Superior_View20.jpg">'
Clinical: '<b>Clinical:</b> Note the retroperitoneal course of the ureters as they pass to the urinary bladder. They course beneath the testicular vessels but over the iliac vessels. They then pass deep to the ductus deferens as they approach the bladder. Surgeons operating in the pelvic cavity must be aware of the retroperitoneal course of the ureters as they can be easily damaged, leading to the extravasation of urine into adjacent retro- and intraperitoneal spaces.<br>'
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b>  The male peritoneum passes from the anterior abdominal wall over the superior surface of the urinary bladder and inferiorly on the posterior surface of the bladder.  It also passes over the superior ends of the seminal vesicles, and it posteriorly lines the rectovesical pouch, the space between the rectum and urinary bladder.  It then reflects onto the superior part of the rectum.  Posteriorly and superiorly, it becomes the sigmoid mesocolon.  <br><br>The testicular vessels and lymphatics lie in a retroperitoneal position and course to and from the deep inguinal ring.  At the ring, notice the retroperitoneal pathway of the ductus deferens as it courses toward the seminal vesicle.  <br><br>Also note the retroperitoneal course of the ureters as they pass to the urinary bladder.  They course beneath the testicular vessels but over the iliac vessels.  They then pass deep to the ductus deferens as they approach the bladder.<br>'
