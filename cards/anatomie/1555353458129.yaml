Clinical: 'The number and distribution of nuclear pore complexes vary widely according to activity and type of cell; they are especially numerous in metabolically active cells. Genetic mutations in the nucleoporin, <i>ALADIN</i>, have been linked to the autosomal recessive <b>Triple-A</b> (<b>Allgrove</b>) <b>syndrome</b>, also known as <i>Achalasia-Addisonianism-Alacrimia</i> syndrome.'
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b> A nuclear envelope encloses the nucleus of interphase cells and separates nucleus from cytoplasm. It consists of two parallel unit membranes separated by a narrow space (10-70 nm wide) termed the <i>perinuclear</i> space (<i>cisterna</i>). Many small octagonal apertures, called nuclear pores, perforate the envelope. About  100 nm in diameter, they permit selective, bidirectional exchange of small molecules, ribosomal subunits, and other substances between nucleus and cytoplasm. The outer rim of each pore forms by fusion of outer and inner nuclear membranes. A nuclear pore complex spanning the opening of each pore consists of eight proteins, or <i>nucleoporins</i>, around a central plug or granule.'
